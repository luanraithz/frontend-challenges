          The desire to be respect by someone of the opposite sex is something
          that runs deep within everyone, even though most people dont't take
          the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people
          are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of
          attention, settling for something for something much less than
          respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship
          grow is by showing respect. <br /> <br />
          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
          What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention,
          or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly the are
          valued.
